This is a Beta GameCredits qt wrapper for .NET. It is written in C#.

It is made by lars holdgaard containing all methods in the GameCredits-qt API (few exceptions such as multi-signature addresses).

Besides the C# wrapper which can be used in any kind of project, there is a MVC 4 project using the GameCredits wrapper. Here the methods are called using jQuery (AJAX), to show how to get information from the running Gamerscoin server to the client.
